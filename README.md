User Registration:
Users begin by downloading and installing the P2P payment app from the respective app store.

They register by providing necessary information, which may include their name, email address, and phone number, and often linking their bank account or credit/debit card.

Linking Payment Sources:
Users link their preferred payment sources, such as bank accounts or credit/debit cards, to the P2P app. This step is crucial for the app to facilitate secure and direct transactions.

Verification Process:
To ensure security, users may undergo a verification process. This can involve confirming their identity through email verification, phone number verification, or additional authentication methods.

Adding Funds:
Users may need to add funds to their P2P app’s account before initiating transactions. This is done by providing the required details such as the IFSC code and the bank name, etc.

Initiating a Transaction:
To send money, users open the app and choose the option to send funds.

They enter the recipient’s details, which may include their username, phone number, email address, or other identification methods supported by the app.

Specifying Amount and Purpose:
Users input the amount they wish to send and, in some cases, can include a note specifying the purpose of the transaction (e.g., splitting a bill, repaying a loan).

Confirmation and Authorization:
Before the transaction is finalized, users review the details, ensuring accuracy in the recipient’s information and transaction amount.

Additional security measures, such as PIN codes, passwords, or biometric authentication, may be required to authorize the transaction.

Transaction Processing:
Once authorized, the P2P app processes the transaction. It communicates with the linked bank accounts or card networks to transfer the funds securely.

Notification and Confirmation:
Both the sender and recipient receive notifications confirming the transaction. Details such as the amount, transaction ID, and any notes attached are typically included.
